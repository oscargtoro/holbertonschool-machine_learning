# 0-slice_me_up.py

Code completion:

- **_arr1_** should be the first two numbers of **_arr_**
- **_arr2_** should be the last five numbers of **_arr_**
- **_arr3_** should be the 2nd through 6th numbers of **_arr_**

# 1-trim_me_down.py

Code completion:

- **_the_middle_** should be a 2D matrix containing the 3rd and 4th columns of **_matrix_**

## Usage

```
(holbertonschool) stiven@stiven-pc:~/Documents/vscode/holbertonschool-machine_learning/math$ ./1-trim_me_down.py
The middle columns of the matrix are: [[9, 4], [7, 3], [4, 6]]
```

# 2-size_me_please.py

Calculates the shape of a matrix, the shape is returned as a list of integers.

## Usage

```
stiven@stiven-pc:0x00-linear_algebra$ ./2-main.py
[2, 2]
[2, 3, 5]
```

# 3-flip_me_over.py

Returns the transpose of the matrix defined in **_3-main.py_**.

## Usage

```
(holbertonschool) stiven@stiven-pc:0x00-linear_algebra$ ./3-main.py
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[1, 3], [2, 4]]
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]]
[[1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26], [2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27], [3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28], [4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29], [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]]
```

# 4-line_up.py

Adds two arrays defined in **_4-main.py_** element-wise, if the shape of the two arrays is not the same returns **_None_**.

## Usage

```
(holbertonschool) stiven@stiven-pc:0x00-linear_algebra$ ./4-main.py
[6, 8, 10, 12]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
None
```

# 5-across_the_planes.py

Adds two matrices defined in **_5-main.py_** element-wise, if the shape of the two matrices is not the same returns **_None_**. Works only in 2D matrices.

## Usage

```
(holbertonschool) stiven@stiven-pc:0x00-linear_algebra$ ./5-main.py
[[6, 8], [10, 12]]
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[5, 6], [7, 8]]
None
```
